      I studied Political Science at New College of Florida and researched sociopolitical phenomena in the <a href = "https://ncfpbl.github.io" target="_blank" style="color:#7C0A02">Political Behavior Lab</a> during the 2021-2022 academic year. I illustrated my findings as maps using GIS tools in R.
